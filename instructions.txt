"This is a 2 player game: you versus the computer.\n\n
Game Play: Each player gets a board with two grids and two ships.\n\n
Goal: To sink all of your opponent's ships by correctly guessing their location using coordinates.\n\n
Setup:\n\n
Give each player a board with two grids, one of each type of ship, and a bunch of hit and miss markers. Pen and paper players should note there is one length 2 ship, two length 3 ships, one length 4 ship, and one length 5 ship.\n\n
Secretly place your ships on the lower grid.\n\n
Each ship must be placed horizontally or vertically (not diagonally) across grid spaces, and can't hang over the grid. Ships can touch each other, but can't both be on the same space.\n\n
Play:\n\n
Players take turns firing a shot to attack enemy ships.\n\n
On your turn, call out a letter and a number of a row and column on the grid. Your opponent checks that space on their lower grid, and says M if there are no ships there, or H if you guessed a space that contained a ship.\n\n
Mark your shots on your upper grid, with white pegs for misses and red pegs for hits, to keep track of your guesses.\n\n
When one of your ships is hit, put a red peg into that ship on your lower grid at the location of the hit. Whenever one of your ships has every slot filled with red pegs, you must announce to your opponent that he has sunk your ship.\n\n
Victory:\n\n
The first player to sink all opposing ships wins.\n\n"
